/**
 * An `Iterable` that provides a very clean interface to the
 * Producer / Consumer pattern.
 *
 * Both the `hasNext` and `next` methods of the `Iterator`
 * may block if the consumer catches up with the producer.
 *
 * If the client wishes to cancel iteration early, the
 * `stop` method may be called to free up resources. Some
 * implementations may introduce a timeout feature which
 * will automatically free or log unclosed resources on
 * idle activity.
 *
 * Functional purists may use this in their `Iteratees`
 * patterns.
 *
 *
 * It is a common misconception that `Iterator.hasNext` is
 * not allowed to block.
 * However, the API documentation does not preclude
 * blocking behaviour. Note that `Queue` implementations
 * return `false` once the consumer reaches the tail â€“ a
 * fundamental difference opposite this trait.
